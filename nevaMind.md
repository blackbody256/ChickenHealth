**An AI-Powered Chicken Health Detection System**

## Problem Statement and Context

In many developing countries, poultry farmers are losing birds and income because they detect diseases too late. Deadly gut diseases like coccidiosis, salmonella, and Newcastle disease cause up to 80% of chicken deaths, often spreading before farmers even know there's a problem. These diseases leave early signs in chicken droppings, but without tools to spot them, farmers can't act in time.

In Uganda, over 4.8 million households rely on poultry farming. Most are small-scale farmers with 50â€“500 birds and no regular access to vets or lab testing. A single outbreak can wipe out half a flock in days, pushing families deeper into poverty.

As one farmer said, "We only notice sickness when birds stop eating or start dying." The current system depends on chicken behavior which is often too late. Farmers urgently need an early, simple, and affordable way to detect disease before it's too late.

## Solution

To address those farmer's problems we came up with a new product called KukuIntel which is an AI-powered mobile platform that helps smallholder poultry farmers detect deadly gut diseases like coccidiosis, Newcastle disease, and salmonella early just by snapping a photo of chicken droppings. Using a deep learning model (EfficientNetB3) with 98.3% accuracy, it gives instant diagnosis and treatment advice right on a basic smartphone.

Farmers get a simple, easy-to-use app with clear guidance. Veterinarians can monitor cases remotely, offer expert advice, and manage outbreaks without being on-site. Behind the scenes, admins maintain system quality and update the AI model to keep accuracy high.

KukuIntel tackles the core problem of late disease detection by turning every farmer's phone into a diagnostic tool and a direct line to vet support. It's not just a tool it's a must-have ally that helps farmers prevent losses, save flocks, and protect their income.
